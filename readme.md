# Introduction
In today’s data-driven world, businesses are continually seeking ways to enhance their operations, make informed decisions, and react swiftly to changing scenarios. This pursuit has led to the evolution of data integration techniques that go beyond traditional methods. One such approach is Change Data Capture (CDC) — a game-changer in data synchronisation that empowers organisations to capture, track, and propagate real-time data changes across distributed systems.

In this article, we delve into the dynamic realm of Change Data Capture, uncovering its potential when harnessed through the combined prowess of Apache Kafka and the Debezium Connector. Whether you’re a data engineer, business analyst, or technology enthusiast, this guide offers valuable insights into the why, when, and how of adopting CDC with Kafka and Debezium.
